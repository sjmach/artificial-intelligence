# Sundeep Machado's AI/ML Portfolio & Article Code

Hi there! üëã Welcome to my AI/ML project repository.

This space is a living collection of my work in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Science**. It primarily serves as the official code repository for all the articles and tutorials I write on www.sundeepmachado.com

My goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practice by providing clean, well-commented code for the concepts I discuss.

## üöÄ Projects & Articles

Here is a list of my work. Each project includes a link to the relevant article (for the "why") and the source code (for the "how").

### 1. Serving an Embedding Model on NVIDIA Triton Server

* **Article:** üîó [Read the full article on my Blog](https://www.sundeepmachado.com/2025/10/how-to-deploy-googles-latest-embedding.html)
* **Description:** An embedding model is needed to generate embeddings (vector representations that help an LLM to understand things like text, images etc). 
Google recently released EmbeddingGemma-300M (a whooping 300 million parameter model) which has very low requirements to run. We test this assumption in this article.

* **Code:** üìÇ [Find the code in the `/nvidia-triton-server/simple/google-embeddinggemma-300m` directory](./nvidia-triton-server/simple/google-embeddinggemma-300m)
